Q.6 

a)LSM6DS3H uses SPI and I2C which are subject to general
 operating conditions for Vdd and Top.

b)The gyro output Angular Rate.

c)Yes, LSM6DS3H can support an output data rate of 200 readings per second. 
The range for Linear acceleration output data rate is 12.5Hz to 6664Hz and 
for Angular rate output data rate 12.5 Hz to 3332Hz.

d)The LSM6DS3H has an internal clock that can be used to synchronize with the Verilog.
The clock can be configured to output a signal when a new set of measurements is ready.
Also, it has two interrupt output pins INT1 & INT2. These pins are active-low, open-drain 
outputs. If there is a new set of measurements is ready then the DRDY (Data Ready) flag 
will set in one of the interrupts.
